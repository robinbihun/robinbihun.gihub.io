I am an engineering leader who believes the best technology is the kind you don't have to think about; it just works. 

With over two decades of turning complex technical challenges into end-user products, I've spent my career making infrastructure more reliable, teams more effective, 
and significantly smaller.

Whether architecting solutions to legacy mainframe software, or automating away the tedious parts of DevOps work,
I approach problems with enthusiasm and pragmatism. 

I'm happiest when mentoring engineers, untangling architectural puzzles, or finding that perfect balance between moving fast and _not_ breaking things.
Based in Chicago, Illinois, I've embraced remote work since before it was cool, leading distributed teams around the country in their cloud environment journeys. 
I've worked everywhere from Fortune 500 insurance companies to scrappy startups, consulting for AWS Infrastructure and building platforms 
that scale while always being the CFO's favorite engineer (cost dashboards anyone?).

*My superpower?* Making complicated technical decisions feel obvious in hindsight and helping teams ship faster without the chaos.
